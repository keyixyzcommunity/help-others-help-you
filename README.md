# help-others-help-you
A place to record goals, and look to help others with their goals


In this repo, KEYI Community members can record their goals, and can help others achieve recorded goals.

Each member may have a folder here named membername.keyi.sol and inside will be text files describing goals with dates set and dates achieved. 

Members are free to add whatever they want to their log, to stay constructive and helpful

Don't be shy about setting goals and asking for help achieving them! We're all here to support each other and grow together. :)


Example: [Ryan's first goal file](ryan.keyi.sol/2024-08-30-goals.md)

The platform hosting these files, GitHub, uses simple formatting called MarkDown. This is a good starting point for understanding markdown - it's made to be very simple https://www.markdownguide.org/
